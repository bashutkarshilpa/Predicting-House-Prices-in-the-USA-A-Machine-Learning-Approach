# Predicting House Prices in USA

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of houses in the USA using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features that influence the price of houses, including average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms, and area population. By leveraging models such as logistic regression, decision trees, bagging, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting, the project aims to accurately predict house prices. The gradient boosting model achieved an impressive accuracy of 89%.
